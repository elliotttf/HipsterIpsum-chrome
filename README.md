Development
===========

The plugin is built using [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) and is deployed
to the local ```dist``` directory. This directory can then be zipped up
to create a package deployment.

To build the package, run:

```
grunt build
```

If a new version isn't being deployed enter the version type:

* ```M``` for major
* ```m``` for minor
* ```p``` for patch

Thanks
